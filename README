popcon-historical
-----------------

A quick little app for examining historical trends in the results from Debian/Ubuntu popularity contest.

You will need:
- A Drizzle database server (any stable version should work)
- Perl DBD:MySQL
- Perl
- Perl Dancer
- Probably to read the source as my instructions are no doubt wrong.
- historical popcon data

All the packages in Ubuntu 12.04 (precise) are recent enough.

To run:
1) Fetch data. I've mirrored some here:
	https://flamingspork.com/popcon-historical/data/
   Debian comes from the Wayback machine
   Ubuntu comes from http://ubuntu-popcon.43-1.org/data/
	The above site has much finer grained results if you're interested,
	going back to 2010.

2) Connect to Drizzle, "CREATE SCHEMA popcon", then run commands
   in create_scheam.sql (e.g. by running ". create_scheam.sql" from drizzle
   command line client).

3) Load data. e.g.:
   $ perl load-popcon.pl --distro=Debian --date=20120303 --file=popcon-debian-2012-03-03.txt.gz

   If you've set up authentication on Drizzle or are running the MySQL protocol
   plugin on a port other than 3306 or create a schema not named 'popcon' then
   you'll have to go edit the script, sorry.

   You currently cannot run more than one of these concurrently. Patches++.

4) Run the web app:
   $ cd PopconHistorical-App
   $ ./bin/app.pl

5) Load up a web browser to http://127.0.0.1:3000 (or whatever Dancer tells you to)
